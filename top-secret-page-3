    <h2>simple price tracker</h2>
    <p>track and chart the price of a list of coins, I'm interested to see if there's a trend with the current top-gainers and to visually see a chart of their trajectory. Perhaps it's possible to generally succeed in taking a percent from each.</p>
    <p>Use this to get the list from Binance:</p>
    <pre>var symbolList = [...document.querySelectorAll('.item-symbol-ba')].map(x => x.innerText);</pre>
    
    <h3>hang on a minute</h3>    
    <p>Why would I track the price myself in a basic way? Also from a browser that's not going to reliably fetch at regular intervals ininterupted (I could set up a node function would be much better btw). It makes way more sense to just make a note of the coin symbols and look them up later.</p>
    <p>perhaps some sort of chart comparison grid would be nice, but also not worth the hours of coding when I could just take screenshots.</p>
