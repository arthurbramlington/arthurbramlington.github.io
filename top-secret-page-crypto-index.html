    <h1>Uncle Liam's Dip Finder</h1>
    <h2>Thoughts:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>fees</li>
      <li>Ooo what would happen if you buy when something enters the top 20 and sell when it either leaves the top 10 (or the top 20 having never made it to the top 10).</li>
      <li>Or a combination of criteria like sell at +3% or when it leaves the top X</li>
      <li>Something might surge like mad, but by the time it leaves the top X it's back where it started. Can't you make a sell trigger into its value losing a certain percentage after entering the top X? So any time it loses a quater of it's max gain since entering the top X. For example if it's gone up to +40% profit from your buy-in and now it's at +30% you sell. this would have to be above a certain number because the difference between 40% and 30% is very different in behavioral terms from 4% to 3%</li>
      <li>what if you gave it specific scapling buy and sell instructions once it enters the top X - it would be hard to know which sell condition was hit first though.</li>
      <li>Factor in market cap or volume? Maybe the ones that have a lot of weight behind them linger for longer.</li>
      <li>How about an option to only buy coins that have previously been in the top 20, thus potentially filtering for major spikers to some extent.</li>
      <li>I wonder if there's merit in waiting for a coin with a sufficient market cap / lending pool to enter the mix and then shorting it.</li>
      <li>Try setting it to 1d, 1 day rating period and top 100, it seems to be exclusively bad. I wonder if you could mass-short</li>
      <li>Anything you buy can only go down by 100%, but it can go up infinitely. Is this an arguement for buying anyhing that's performed more than 0? Or maybe even ignoreing the price performance entirely and just buying anything that's had market cap growth.</li>
      <li>I'm wondering if you're buying the top 100 it would be worth leaving out the top 10-20, they're probably too hot and basically on the path to crashing... But that being said, if you're only selling when a coin leaves the top 100 you're only ever selling when something has completely tanked - that being said , think of a rocket, you might buy something for $0.1, but you wouldn't hold it all the way up to $10, it would keep dropping out of the top 100 whenever it has a bad day. So then buying the top 100 day performers is stupid because the list will change constantly.</li>
    </ul>
